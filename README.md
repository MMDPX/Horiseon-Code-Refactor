# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

## Description

The motivation for the project was replacing non-semantic HTML tags on Horiseon's website with semantic tags. Using semantic tags makes the code more readable, as well as making it easier to use for some, for example disabled users accessing the page with screen readers.
